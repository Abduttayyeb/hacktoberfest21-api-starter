## Build the Halloween Costume Contest API!

You have chosen to build an API ðŸŽ‰! This API should allow users to create, read, update, delete, and upvote Halloween costume party contestants.

### Requirements

You can use ANY tech stack you want, as long is it matches the schema with 7 endpoints, and passes all the tests.

Endpoints:
```
- GET /
- GET /contestants
- GET /contestants/:id
- PATCH /contestants/:id
- DELETE /contestants/:id
- POST /contestants
- PATCH /contestants/:id/upvote
```

To see what types of responses your API should return, check out the [schema](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Hacktoberfest'21-~1ae1036b-6583-4883-949e-adf8b55687a1/api/b8ee9c39-4eb5-46c0-94e0-d643d9064ba9/version/77aea2ac-8b58-4314-82a6-847b40547c1f?tab=define). 

Your API will need to pass the series of tests in this collection: [Test collection](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Hacktoberfest'21-~1ae1036b-6583-4883-949e-adf8b55687a1/collection/15567703-96f91b20-f497-43aa-a7f9-f1443bdd3a71?ctx=documentation)

### How to use the API 

In the API-First approach, a mock server has been created based off of the Halloween Costume Contest API. 

You can fork the mock server, and make real request to get dummy data from the various endpoints.
